**Execute the GameRunner.java class to create a new instance of the simulation**

I have provided all the implementation as requested on the Sakai.  
-By default, there is a 10x10 grid. 
-Click the 'Resize Board' to change the board to any dimension between (10,10) and (500,500). 

-All the other requested features are implemented and can be used by choosing one of the various buttons on the UI.  
-The code has been implemented using MVC Architecture. 


**All Features:**

+Ability to change the size of the field from 10x10 up to 500x500.  
+Ability to manually set / clear any cell in order to set up patterns. 
+Ability to clear the entire field.  
+Ability to fill the field randomly.  
+Ability to advance the game by pressing a button.  
+Written with a Model View Controller architecture. 
+Ability to set the "survive" and "birth" thresholds to custom values.  
+Ability to toggle "torus" mode on or off. In torus mode, the field is treated as if it wraps around the edges back to the other edge.  
+A start/stop button that advances the game automatically using a separate thread with a delay between updates settable between 10 milliseconds and 1 second.
